<h2>What is a good password?</h2>

<p>Too many sites have byzantine requirements for passwords that don't
  actually help make them all that much more secure.  Some sites require
  you to change your password regularly, which probably has more
  drawbacks than benefits.  Below, I will give you a couple of ways to
  generate a good password.  However, it turns out that how you manage
  your passwords is perhaps more important than the choice of the
  password itself.  As long as your password isn't too short (at least 8
  or 12 letters long) and isn't a dictionary word, common proper name,
  or common thing like "password123", your password is less likely to be
  guessed than it is to be lost other ways.</p>

<p>If a password isn't leaked, there are a few general ways it can be
  guessed: a dictionary attack, using personal information, and
  brute-force cracking.  Dictionary attacks and brute-force
  cracking <i>usually</i> require offline access to a password
  database.  A well-designed password database will store your password
  encrypted, so attackers can't just read it off if it's leaked.
  In both of these cases, they then try lots of possibilities to see if
  they encrypt to the encrypted form of your password.  These attacks
  can go over the net, but the large number of attempts necessary will
  tend to make the attack noticed by security monitoring software.</p>

<p>A <b>dictionary attack</b> is where the attacker tries words from a
  list against the password.  There are <i>many</i> fewer six-to-twelve
  letter words than there are combinations of 12 random letters.  If
  your password is a word in the dictionary, then it's easy to guess.
  Even if you try to substitute some letters for numbers and symbols—
  using "p@ssw0rd" instead of "password"— that is also easy to guess, as
  password crackers all know the common substitutions.  A good password
  should not be a dictionary word, and ideally should be randomly
  generated.</p>

<p>Attacks that <b>use personal information</b> might be more, er,
  personal.  Bad passwords are any word that is connected to you
  somehow; your birthdate, the name of your kids, the city where you
  were born, etc.  All of these things can be automatically guessed by
  scraping information about you from the web.  If somebody is
  targeting you personally, then they might try other things they know
  about you: your favorite color, the name of your first pet, etc.
  Even if you substitute letters with numbers and symbols (so that the
  name Robert becomes R0ber+), these passwords are not very
  secure.</p>

<p>A <b>brute-force</b> attack is like a dictionary attack, only here
  the cracker is not assuming that the password is a word or a name or
  something intelligible, but could really be a random collection of
  letters or words.  For, say, an eight-letter password, a computer
  tries every single combination of eight letters to see if it works.
  That amounts to 26⁸, or 100 billion, different passwords, even if the
  password is only lower-case letters.  While 100 billion sounds like a
  lot to you and me, it's actually not as much to a computer nowadays as
  you might think.  When evaluating the strength of a password against a
  brute-force attack, people often talk about "<b>bits of entropy</b>".
  More bits of entropy means more tries, on average, somebody will have
  to make before stumbling across your password.  Eight lowercase
  letters, assuming they're chosen completely randomly, have about 37
  bits of entropy.</p>

<p>How many bits of entropy is enough?  More is always better, of
  course, but passwords become more cumbersome the longer they get.
  Adding even one bit of entropy approximately doubles the amount of
  time it takes to crack your password.  It makes a difference whether
  your password is attacked online, or if the attacker has the encrypted
  password on their own computer.  In the former case, 37 bits of
  entropy is almost certainly sufficient.  In the latter case, somebody
  who knew what they were doing using a standard high-end graphics card
  could crack that password in minutes, although it depends a lot on the
  algorithm used to encrypt your password.  If you want to be secure
  against people who are really serious about cracking your password,
  you probably need 100-200 bits of entropy.  However, such passwords
  are impractical (do you want to memorize a random string of 40 or more
  letters?). Myself, I tend to aim for around 60 bits of entropy in my
  passwords.</p>

<h2>Password Hygiene</h2>

<p>How you handle your passwords is more important than what the
  password is.  You should do all of the following:</p>

<ul>
  <li><p><b>Don't use the same password twice.</b>  This is the biggest
      mistake most people make: they use the same password everywhere.
      The problem is that there are security breaches all the time.
      Databases of passwords get leaked.  If you've used a password in a
      leaked database, and it's associated with your email address, then
      bad actors will try using your email address and that password at
      all other sites.  You can avoid this problem by using different
      passwords everywhere.</p>

    <p>This can get a little overwhelming, especially now that so many
      websites ask you to register for an account before you can read or
      post anything.  What I do is have one "throwaway" password I use
      on all sites where it's not that big a deal if all of those
      accounts are compromised.  However, for your bank, for your email, for
      any login at work, for anything you've paid money for, and for
      anything that could cause serious embarrassment if your account was
      hacked (this would include all social media), you should use a
      different password for every site.</p>

  <li><p><b>Never send your password through email or text or other open
      communication.</b>  Having your password sit on an email server
      provides another place where a security breach may release it to
      the world.  If you <i>must</i> email a password, learn how to use
      cryptography software and send the password encrypted.  (Sadly,
      good solutions for encrypted email exist, it's never received wide
      adoption, likely in part because government and law enforcement
      always push objections and raise fears of terrorists and the
      like.)</p></li>

  <li><p><b>Don't tell other people your password.</b>  If the system
      administrator of your bank (or any other place you have an
      account) asks for your password, don't give it to them.  They
      don't need it.  (If they do, they've designed their system very
      poorly.)  They can do the superuser things they need to do without
      having to have your password.</p></li>

  <li><p><b>Writing your password down <i>might</i> be OK.</b>  This
      depends on the password.  Don't leave your work password on a
      sticky-note on your work computer; then anybody who comes to your
      desk can log into your account.  However, if you keep a notebook
      at home where you record your logins to various online accounts,
      this is actually not as big a deal as it might seem.  (Just be
      prepared to change <i>all</i> of them if you lose the notebook or
      if your house gets robbed.)  However, there's a better
      solution:</p></li>

  <li><p><b>Consider using a password safe application.</b>  There are
      applications that store all your passwords encrypted.  That way,
      you only have to remember <i>one</i> password— the one you used to
      encrypt your list of passwords.  These applications generally let
      you cut and paste the password into your web browser, or wherever
      you need it.  This lets you use a completely different, completely
      unrememberable password for every account.  Store it in your
      password safe, and, whatever you do, <i>don't</i> forget the
      password you use to unlock that password safe.  You can find lots
      of password safe applications out there, but one I recommend is
      the cross-platform
      open-source <a href="https://keepass.info/">KeePass</a>.  You
      can run it on any operating system, and share the password safe
      file between devices.  (Personally, I just use an encrypted text
      file, but the principle is the same.)</p></li>
</ul>

<h2>"Four random words" passwords</h2>

<p>A dictionary attack works because if you choose any word randomly
  from the dictionary, it only has about 15 bits of entropy.  However,
  if you choose <i>four</i> random words, you're up to 60 bits of
  entropy.  This method of creating passwords was popularized by Randall
  Munroe in his <a href="https://xkcd.com/936/">correct horse battery
  staple</a> XKCD comic.  (Note that he lists 44 bits of entropy,
  whereas I list 60.  The difference?  He's assuming "common" words,
  which are easier to remember.  I'm randomly choosing words between 4
  and 8 letters without requiring they be common.)</p>

<p>Here's the catch: for this password to be good, <b>the words have to
    be truly random</b>.  If you just think up four words yourself, you
  have <i>many</i> fewer bits of entropy than you would with random
  words.  People will tend to think of certain words together, and
  sophisticated password crackers will take advantage of this to
  reduce the number of word combinations they have to try.  How do you
  generate random words?  With a computer.  Click the button below to
  generate a "four random word" password.</p>

<p>Words between <input id="minletters" type="number" min="3" max="8" value="4" style="width: 3em"> and
  <input id="maxletters" type="number" min="5" max="12" value="8" style="width: 3em"> letters,
  <select id="startcaps">
    <option value="including">including</option>
    <option value="not including" selected>not including</option>
  </select>
  words that start with a capital letter (proper names, etc.).<br>
  <input type="button" id="generatefourwords" value="Generate Password"></p>

<div style="border: 2px solid black; padding: 1em; text-align: center; display: none" id="fourwordpassword"></div>

<a id="randomcharacters"></a>
<h2>"Random characters" passwords</h2>

<p>These sorts of passwords are harder to remember than "random words"
  passwords, but they require less typing.  Again, the password is
  better if the characters are <i>truly random</i>, which letters you
  think up out of your head won't be.</p>

<p><input id="numrandomletters" type="number" min="8" max="16"  value="12" style="width: 3em"> random letters<br>
  <input id="randomcapitals" type="checkbox" checked> Include capital letters? <br>
  <input id="randomnumbers" type="checkbox"> Include numbers? <br>
  <input id="randomsymbols" type="checkbox"> Include random symbols?  (Symbols used: !@#$%^&amp;*()_-+=:;,.&lt;&gt;/?~{}[]|) <br>
  <input type="button" id="generatebarf" value="Generate Password">
